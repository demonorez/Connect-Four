## I wouldn't have had the inspiration wihtout personal thanks to Riot Games and everyone who created League of Legends and the Arcane Netflix show. 

You guys are the real heros! 

Below are the links I used to get the images and audio for this game, but again ALL thank should go to riot games as they are the creators of everything you see here.
