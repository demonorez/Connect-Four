Everyone knows Connect-Four. I chose this game because it would be a fun first project to create and fully stylize. My love for League of Legends inspired this.

For those of you unfamiliar with the rules, you place a piece in the gameboard. Then the other player places their piece. This goes back and forth until one of you manage to get four in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagnally.
